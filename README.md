It is a production tool for a project aimed at porting a remake of a Famicom game to Windows.

The source code used in this project can be freely utilized by anyone.

However, claiming the creator of this entire project under a name other than mine is dangerous due to potential infringement of portrait rights.

Furthermore, it should be noted that this source code may be incomplete, as it includes configurations uniquely devised by u7. For instance, misappropriation of this code leading to damages would solely be the responsibility of the user.

Thank you for your understanding.
