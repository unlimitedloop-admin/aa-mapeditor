It is a production tool for a project to port a remake of a Famicom game to Windows.

The source code used in this can be used freely by anyone.

However, it is dangerous to claim the creator of this entire project under a name other than mine. It is because of the fatal fear of portrait rights.

Also, this source code may be incomplete because it may have a configuration uniquely devised by u7.
For example, if you misappropriate this and damage occurs, it will be transferred only to your responsibility.

Many thanks
